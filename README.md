# System-Analysis-for-DriverPass
System design and business requirements for the DriverPass website

    The main goal of the DriverPass project was to design user-friendly system to provide educational and practice materials for future drivers. The DriverPass is a company that wants to increase the percentage of drivers who pass the test at the DMV. The client wanted to create web-based system that offers different packages, online classes, practice tests and instructions.  
      I think I did well with designing activity diagram, evaluating the system and describing business requirements. I would revise Gantt Charts and class diagram. I think I need more practice on this subject. 
      There are many ways to interpret the userâ€™s needs, user research and interviews, surveys are some of the techniques that used to understand the people we are creating systems for. We need to explore customers needs, expectations and goals in order to design successful product. Based on received information , we can create diagrams, charts that will help to understand the designing process. 
        I would approach designing software by following all of the steps that we performed in this class. Collecting requirements from the client, analyzing it, breaking down into sections, prioritizing based on importance of the subject - theses are some steps I believe will lead to the success.
